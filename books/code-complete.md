"In software construction, trying to create truly original work is often less effective than
focusing on the reuse of design ideas, code, and test cases from previous projects."

"You might think that all professional programmers know about the importance of preparation and check 
that the prerequisities have been satisfied before jumping into construction. Unfortunately, that isn't so."

"Explicit requirements help to ensure that the user rather than the programmer drives the system's functionality.

"Programmers working with high-level languages achieve better productivity and quality than those working with lower-level languages. Languages such as C++, Java, Smalltalk, and Visual Basic have been credited with improving productivity, reliability, simplicity, and comprehensibility by factors of 5 to 15 over low-level languages such as assembly and C. You save time when you don't need to have an awards ceremony every time a C statement does what it's supposed to."

"The most radical solution to building software is not to build it at allâ€”to buy it instead or to download open-source software for free."
